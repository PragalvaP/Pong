  	<p><font color="red">I want this game to be very upbeat while also evoking curiosity. I want the player to be curious about thing such as life outside of earth and have an 
	upbeat 8-bit music theme. This game should put the player in a comfortable and happy mood.</font></p>
  	<p><h3>Destiny: First Memorable Moment</h3></p>
	<p><font color="blue">The first memorable moment in my favorite game Destiny is when the player picks up their first gun: The Khvostov. The gun itself was considered 
	one of the worst in the game because it was just the starting weapon. However, it is something that many players (including myself) never got rid of. For me, the gun 
	marked the beginning of an adventure that would last many years. While it was memorable at the time, it became something even more meaningful the more I played the game. 
	Throughout the years, I would keep The Khvostov in my vault and use it every once in a while to remind myself of where I started. While the gun heavily crippled my character 
	because of how weak it was, it was always something that held great nostalgic value.</font></p>
	<p>This is the Khvostov at an attack of 5 in Example 1:</p>
	<p>Example 1: <IMG SRC=https://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/e_sharpen:100/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1/gameskinnyc/k/h/v/khvostov-84756.png"></p>
	<p>The gun ended up making a comeback in the form of the highest rarity: Exotic. The first gun players picked up had so much meaning that the creators of the game decided to 
	add an exotic version of it. The new exotic Khvostov could be used at the same level as the other high-level guns, but it never felt the same as the original Khvostov. While 
	the new one could be used in high-level play, it could never replace the very first gun I picked up.</p>
		<p>This is the exotic Khvostov in Example 2:</p>
